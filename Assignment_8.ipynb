    "1)Built-in function:\n",
    "Built-in functions are pre-defined functions that are provided by the Python programming language. These functions are readily available and can be used without requiring any additional steps or importing modules. Examples of built-in functions include print(), len(), max(), min(), and type().\n",
    "Example of a built-in function:\n",
    "    result = len(\"Hello\")\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "2)User-defined function:\n",
    "User-defined functions are created by the users or developers to perform specific tasks or operations as per their requirements. These functions are defined using the def keyword followed by a function name, parentheses for optional parameters, and a colon to indicate the beginning of the function block. Users can define their own logic, encapsulate it within the function, and invoke it whenever needed.\n",

    "greet(\"Muniraju\")  # Output: Hello, Muniraju!\n",

    "In this example, the user-defined function greet() is created to greet a person by name. The function takes a parameter name and prints a greeting message using that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined functions allow developers to modularize their code, improve reusability, and create custom operations tailored to their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Python, there are multiple ways to pass arguments to a function. The two common ways are using positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Positional Arguments:\n",
    "Positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order. The function receives the arguments in the same order as they are provided in the function call. The number and order of arguments in the function call must match the function definition.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "In this example, the function add() expects two positional arguments a and b. When calling the function, we provide 3 as the value for a and 5 as the value for b. The function adds these two values and returns the result, which is printed as 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Keyword Arguments:\n",
    "Keyword arguments are passed to a function using their corresponding parameter names. The function call explicitly specifies the argument names and their values. Keyword arguments allow flexibility in the order of arguments as the arguments are mapped by their names.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def greet(first_name, last_name):\n",
    "    return \"Hello, \" + first_name + \" \" + last_name + \"!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "greeting = greet(first_name=\"Alice\", last_name=\"Smith\")\n",
    "print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice Smith!\n",
    "In this example, the function greet() expects two keyword arguments first_name and last_name. Instead of relying on the order of arguments, we explicitly specify the argument names and their values in the function call. The function concatenates the names and returns the greeting message, which is stored in the variable greeting and printed as Hello, Alice Smith!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments are useful when a function has multiple parameters and you want to provide values only for specific parameters, without relying on their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that in Python, you can also mix positional and keyword arguments in a function call. However, positional arguments must be provided before keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def example(a, b, c):\n",
    "    # Function logic\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mixing positional and keyword arguments\n",
    "example(1, b=2, c=3)\n",
    "In summary, positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position, while keyword arguments are passed using their corresponding parameter names. Keyword arguments provide flexibility in argument order, making the code more readable and self-explanatory"

    "It provides the output or result of the function to the caller.\n",
    "It terminates the execution of the function, exiting the function and returning control to the caller.\n",

    "print(result)  # Output: 9\n",

    "\n",
    "When the function maximum(5, 9) is called, the return value 9 is assigned to the variable result, and then it is printed. The value 9 is returned because 9 is the larger of the two arguments passed to the function.\n",

    "Lambda functions are different from regular functions in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: Lambda functions are defined in a more concise and compact syntax compared to regular functions. They are typically single-line expressions rather than multi-line function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nameless: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they are not assigned a name like regular functions. They are primarily used where a small, one-time function is required without the need for reusability or a function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited functionality: Lambda functions are limited in functionality compared to regular functions. They can only consist of a single expression and cannot contain statements or multiple lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example where a lambda function can be useful:\n",
    "\n",

    "Local Scope:\n",
    "Variables defined within a function have a local scope. These variables are only accessible within the function in which they are defined. Local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function completes execution. They cannot be accessed or modified outside of the function.\n",

When the function is called, x is assigned the value 10 and printed within the function. However, trying to access x outside the function results in a NameError because x is not defined in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Scope:\n",
    "Variables defined outside of any function, at the top level of a module, have a global scope. Global variables are accessible throughout the entire module, including within any functions defined within the module. They can be accessed, modified, and shared by multiple functions.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "x = 10  # Global variable\n",

    "my_function()\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 10\n",
    "In this example, the variable x is defined outside of any function, making it a global variable. It can be accessed both within the my_function() function and outside of it. The function can access and use the global variable x without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that local variables take precedence over global variables with the same name. If a local variable is defined within a function with the same name as a global variable, the local variable will be used within the function, and it won't affect the value of the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables. Local scope applies to variables defined within a function, making them accessible only within that function. Global scope applies to variables defined outside of any function, making them accessible throughout the entire module. Understanding scope is crucial for managing variable access, preventing naming conflicts, and writing structured and maintainable code."

    "\n",
    "1)Use descriptive names: Choose variable names that are meaningful and describe the purpose or content of the variable. This helps in understanding the code and its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Use lowercase letters: Variable names should be in lowercase letters, and words can be separated by underscores (\"snake_case\"). For example: user_name, item_count.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Avoid single-letter names: Unless used as loop counters or indices, avoid single-letter variable names as they are often not descriptive enough. Use meaningful names that indicate the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Be consistent: Maintain consistency in naming conventions throughout your codebase. If you start using a specific naming style, stick to it consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Use lowercase for module-level constants: If you have module-level constants, use lowercase letters with underscores to separate words. For example: max_attempts, default_timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)Use uppercase for global constants: Global constants should be written in uppercase letters with underscores to separate words. For example: PI, DEFAULT_PORT.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)Avoid reserved keywords: Do not use Python reserved keywords (such as if, for, while, etc.) as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)Follow class naming conventions: Class names should use CamelCase notation (also known as PascalCase), where each word starts with an uppercase letter. For example: Car, CustomerAccount.\n",
    "\n",
    "9)Use self-explanatory names for objects: When naming objects or instances, use names that clearly indicate their purpose or role within the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)Avoid name clashes: Be mindful of potential name clashes with built-in functions or modules. Try to use unique names that are less likely to conflict with existing Python functionality."

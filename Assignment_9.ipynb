    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",

    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",

    "This lambda function takes two arguments x and y and returns their sum.\n",

    "One of the key differences between lambda functions and regular functions is that lambda functions are anonymous and don't have a name. They are typically used when you need a simple function for a short period of time and don't want to define a named function explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are often used in functional programming paradigms and are commonly used with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(). These functions take a lambda function as an argument to perform operations on lists, sequences, or other iterable objects.\n",

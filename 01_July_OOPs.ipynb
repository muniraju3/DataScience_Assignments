    "Class variables: They are often used to store data that is shared among all instances of a class. For example, if you have a class representing a car, a class variable like num_wheels = 4 can be used to store the number of wheels, which would be the same for all cars. Class variables can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class.\n",
    "Instance variables: They are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class.

    "\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter in class methods serves as a reference to the instance of the class itself. It is a convention to name the first parameter of an instance method as self, although you can technically choose any name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the self parameter is to allow instance methods to access and modify the instance's attributes (instance variables) and invoke other methods of the same instance. When a method is called on an instance, the instance itself is automatically passed as the self argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few key points regarding the purpose and usage of the self parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing instance attributes: Inside an instance method, you can access the instance's attributes (instance variables) using the self parameter. For example, self.attribute_name. This allows the method to retrieve and operate on the specific data associated with the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying instance attributes: Instance methods can modify the instance's attributes by assigning values to them using the self parameter. For example, self.attribute_name = new_value. This allows the method to update the state of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoking other instance methods: By using the self parameter, an instance method can invoke other methods of the same instance. This allows for method chaining and organizing related functionality within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing instance variables from local variables: The self parameter is used to differentiate between instance variables and local variables within a method. Without self, the method would treat a variable as a local variable and not access or modify the instance's attributes."

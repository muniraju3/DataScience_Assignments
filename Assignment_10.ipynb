    "The role of a try-except block, also known as an exception handling block, is to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of a program. Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of the program. These exceptions can be caused by various factors, such as invalid input, file access errors, network issues, or programming mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try-except block allows you to write code that anticipates potential exceptions and provides a mechanism to handle them gracefully. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within the try block is the section of code where you anticipate that an exception may occur.\n",
    "If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution of the code within the try block is immediately stopped.\n",
    "The program then looks for an except block that matches the type of exception raised. An except block is a section of code that defines how to handle a specific type of exception.\n",
    "If a matching except block is found, the code within that block is executed, providing an opportunity to handle the exception. This can involve logging the error, displaying an error message, or taking corrective action.\n",
    "If no matching except block is found, the exception is propagated up the call stack to the next level of exception handling. This continues until a matching except block is found or until the exception reaches the top-level of the program, resulting in a program termination.\n",
    "Here's an example of a try-except block in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0  # Division by zero exception\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Exception handling code\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "In this example, the try block attempts to divide 10 by 0, which raises a ZeroDivisionError. Since we have an except block specifically for ZeroDivisionError, the code within the except block is executed, and the program displays the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using try-except blocks allows you to handle exceptions gracefully and prevent your program from crashing when errors occur. It provides a way to handle exceptional cases and take appropriate actions, improving the robustness and reliability of your code."

    "\n",
    "When using a specific exception type in an except block, you specify the exact type of exception that you want to catch and handle.\n",

    "You can provide specific error messages, perform appropriate actions, or apply tailored error handling logic based on the type of exception caught.\n",
    "This approach allows you to anticipate and handle specific exceptions while letting other exceptions propagate up the call stack or be caught by other except blocks that are specifically designed to handle them.\n",
